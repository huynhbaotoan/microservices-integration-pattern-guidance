# Microservices Integration Pattern Guidance

This repository contains comprehensive guidance on microservices integration patterns with a focus on AWS services, particularly Amazon MSK (Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka) and related event-driven architectures.

## Overview

Modern microservices architectures require robust integration patterns to ensure reliable, scalable, and maintainable communication between services. This repository provides detailed guidance, best practices, and implementation examples for various integration patterns using AWS services.

## Contents

### Core Integration Patterns

- [MSK Integration Patterns](./msk-integration-patterns.md) - Core patterns for integrating services using Amazon MSK
- [Advanced Integration Patterns](./advanced-integration-patterns.md) - Advanced techniques for complex microservices architectures

### Decision Guides

- [AWS Event Services Decision Graph for MSK](./aws-event-services-decision-graph-msk.md) - Decision framework for choosing between AWS event services with MSK focus
- [Kafka/MSK Decision Graph](./kafka-msk-decision-graph.md) - Guide to making architectural decisions with Kafka and Amazon MSK

### Implementation Guides

- [Hybrid MSK-SQS Architecture](./hybrid-msk-sqs-architecture.md) - Implementing a hybrid architecture using both MSK and SQS
- [Deploying MSK-SQS Bridge](./deploying-msk-sqs-bridge.md) - Step-by-step guide to deploying a bridge between MSK and SQS
- [Scaling MSK Topics](./scaling-msk-topics.md) - Best practices for scaling Kafka topics in Amazon MSK

### Error Handling and Resilience

- [Implementing DLQ with MSK](./implementing-dlq-with-msk.md) - Dead Letter Queue implementation with Amazon MSK
- [DLQ Message Handling](./dlq-message.md) - Strategies for handling messages in Dead Letter Queues

## Getting Started

To get the most out of this repository:

1. Start with the decision guides to understand which integration patterns best suit your use case
2. Review the core integration patterns documentation
3. Follow the implementation guides for practical examples
4. Refer to the error handling documentation to build resilient systems

## Key Concepts

- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Design pattern where services communicate through events
- **Message Brokers**: Intermediaries that handle message delivery between services
- **Dead Letter Queues (DLQ)**: Storage for messages that cannot be processed successfully
- **Hybrid Architectures**: Combining different messaging services for optimal performance
